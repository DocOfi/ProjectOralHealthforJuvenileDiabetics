Diabetes and Oral Health share certain Commonalities
========================================================
incremental: true

- Sugar intake largely determines disease in oral health and diabetes.
- Success in improving oral health and blood sugar levels are largely dependent on the patient's knowledge and motivation.
- Both require considerable amount of money.  Diabetes requires frequent monitoring  of blood sugar levels, daily injections of insulin while dental treatment is not subsidize by the medical insurance.
- Increasing awareness and educating the patient has been shown to be highly effective in improving oral health and diabetes

Patient Profile
========================================================
Patients in these study were recruited from the Philippine General Hospital, Institute for Studies in Diabetes Foundation, Inc., and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation Philippines, Inc. Only about half (34/65 or 47.9%) of the participants monitored their blood sugar at home at least once a day.

DMFT index among Type 1 Diabetics
========================================================

The DMFT index is a simple count of the number of decayed, missing and filled teeth in an individual averaged over a population or age group.  It is a widely accepted method for comparing prevalence of tooth decay between populations

```
  AgeGrp Decayed Missing Filled DMFT
1    1-5     1.0     0.0    2.5  3.5
2   6-10     6.9     0.5    0.8  8.2
3  11-15     6.6     0.8    1.3  8.7
4  16-20    11.4     1.0    1.7 14.3
5  21-25     8.9     3.5    1.4 14.3
6  26-30     5.4     7.5    4.3 19.3
```

Oral Health = Systemic Health
========================================================

A common risk factor approach to improving oral and systemic health among patients with diabetes may offer a better solution.
