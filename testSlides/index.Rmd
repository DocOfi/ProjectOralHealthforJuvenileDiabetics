## In the beginning... 

> - In 1996, Project Oral Health for Juvenile Diabetics (POHJD) was initiated to provide dental treatment to type 1 diabetics in Metro Manila.  The project was started with the premise that the oral health of type 1 diabetic patients is largely neglected because of the financial demands of diabetes and the lack of information regarding the importance of oral health among children and families of patients with diabetes.  

> - In 1997, funding for the project ($8,613.89) was provided by the Jash Ressei Committee from Japan through the Religious of the Sacred Heart, a religious organization here in the Philippines.

> - Patients were recruited from the Philippine General Hospital, non-governmental organizations such as the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation Philippines, Inc. (JDFPI), Diabetes Care (Diacare), and the Institute for Studies in Diabetes Foundation, Inc. (ISDFI). Private physicians engaged in the practice of treating patients with diabetes were informed of the project as well.

> - 202 consultations and oral examinations, 114 pocket probing, and 431 x-ray examinations were performed

> - 449 teeth were restored using amalgam, composite and glass ionomer restorations

> - Only 19 Root Canal Treatments compared to 212 tooth extractions were performed

> - 226 pit and fissure sealants and 53 topical fluoride applications

> - 155 scaling and polishing (removal of tartar) and 28 root planings (treatment for periodontitis) were performed

## DMFT Index

<div>The<span style="color:blue"> DMFT</span> index is a simple count of the number of <span style="color:blue">decayed, missing and filled</span> teeth in an individual averaged over a population or age group.  It is a widely accepted method for comparing prevalence of tooth decay between populations. Adding <span style="color:blue">D, M, and F </span>yields the DMFT score.</div>

<br>

```{r echo = F, results = 'asis', fig.align="center"}
suppressMessages(require(rCharts))
library(knitr)
pohjd <- read.csv("assets/data/pohjd.csv")
print(kable(pohjd))
```

## Barriers to Access to Dental Care

<br>

* The following were the reasons cited by the respondents for their reluctance to seek dental treatment: 
    - cost of dental consultation and management (cited by 50%); 
    - difficulty in finding dentists who are willing to treat diabetic patients (30.8%); 
    - fear of dental procedures (24.4%); 
    - the need to obtain medical clearance (14.1%); and 
    - fear of delayed healing (17%) and of uncontrolled bleeding (10%). 
 
 _A third of the patients also related a previous experience of being refused dental treatment by a dentist._

## Insights learned from POHJD

> - There is a tendency for type 1 diabetic patients to neglect their oral health due to financial constraints and lack of motivation and/or education to seek dental treatment. POHJD participants have been known to underdose their insulin or use expired insulin in order to cut cost of medication.

> - Despite the presence of enormous amounts of dental pathology in their mouths and the offer of free dental treatment, there is a poor attendance among patients at POHJD. We estimate that POHJD was only able to treat 10-15 % of the type 1 diabetic population
in Manila.

> - Patient participation grew when insulin, insulin syringes, and blood glucose monitoring strips were given free to the patients.

--- .blue

## Insights learned from POHJD

> - Patient compliance to doctors prescribed diet improved while the patients were undergoing dental treatment. Basic information that diabetic patients should know was reinforced during dental visits. Blood sugar testing before dental treatment helped patients to appreciate the importance of monitoring their blood sugar at home and during dental visits.

> - Effects of sugar on other parts of the bodies like the eyes and kidneys, became easier for diabetic children and youth to understand when they see the effects of sugar on their teeth and the pain and problems that it brings. The unpleasant experience of tooth extraction translates into increased motivation to control blood sugar to avoid the effects of high blood sugar on the eyes and other organs.

> - The lack of a systematic recall program failed to sustain the gains acquired and allowed new decay to reappear in other teeth. Preventive programs was not given much stress at the start of theproject as efforts were concentrated in treatment of decayed teeth.

--- .blue

## Insights learned from POHJD

> - The lack of information materials or brochures on oral health resulted in poor retention of concepts learned while on the dental chair. Educational materials on oral health became available only on 2014 after a grant from Engineer David M Consunji.

> - Unless patients are encouraged to attend school, many children with diabetes will never become self-sufficient to address the demands of their disease and remain dependent on family for assistance or hand-outs. Many content themselves without any actual income and serve the members of the family by doing household chores.
