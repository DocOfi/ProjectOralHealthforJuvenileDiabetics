## In the beginning... 

> - In 1996, Project Oral Health for Juvenile Diabetics (POHJD) was initiated to provide dental treatment to type 1 diabetics in Metro Manila.  The project was started with the premise that the oral health of type 1 diabetic patients is largely neglected because of the financial demands of diabetes and the lack of information regarding the importance of oral health among children and families of patients with diabetes.  

> - In 1997, funding for the project ($8,613.89) was provided by the Jash Ressei Committee from Japan through the Religious of the Sacred Heart, a religious organization here in the Philippines.

> - Patients were recruited from the Philippine General Hospital, non-governmental organizations such as the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation Philippines, Inc. (JDFPI), Diabetes Care (Diacare), and the Institute for Studies in Diabetes Foundation, Inc. (ISDFI). Private physicians engaged in the practice of treating patients with diabetes were informed of the project as well.

## DMFT Index

<div>The<span style="color:blue"> DMFT</span> index is a simple count of the number of <span style="color:blue">decayed, missing and filled</span> teeth in an individual averaged over a population or age group.  It is a widely accepted method for comparing prevalence of tooth decay between populations. Adding <span style="color:blue">D, M, and F </span>yields the DMFT score.</div>

<br>


|AgeGrp | Decayed| Missing| Filled| DMFT|
|:------|-------:|-------:|------:|----:|
|1-5    |     1.0|     0.0|    2.5|  3.5|
|6-10   |     6.9|     0.5|    0.8|  8.2|
|11-15  |     6.6|     0.8|    1.3|  8.7|
|16-20  |    11.4|     1.0|    1.7| 14.3|
|21-25  |     8.9|     3.5|    1.4| 14.3|
|26-30  |     5.4|     7.5|    4.3| 19.3|

## Barriers to Access to Dental Care

<br>

* The following were the reasons cited by the respondents for their reluctance to seek dental treatment: 
    - cost of dental consultation and management (cited by 50%); 
    - difficulty in finding dentists who are willing to treat diabetic patients (30.8%); 
    - fear of dental procedures (24.4%); 
    - the need to obtain medical clearance (14.1%); and 
    - fear of delayed healing (17%) and of uncontrolled bleeding (10%). 
 
 _A third of the patients also related a previous experience of being refused dental treatment by a dentist._
